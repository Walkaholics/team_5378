## Motivation
As more people are becoming aware of the significance of health, there is an even greater need for reliable health information. Especially for some university students, who spend most of their time studying hard, they might develop some health problems such as anxiety disorders, Binge Eating Disorders, and obesity. However, it is difficult for them to understand their personal health conditions and make efficient approaches to alleviate it. This discourages them from taking the first step towards their health goals.

Thus, we want to provide a professional analysis on users’ personal health data(e.g. Age, height, weight, body fat percentage, sleep time) to recommend ways to improve their quality of life. We hope that our app could help users tackle some health issues(psychologically and physically) and have a healthier lifestyle.
## Aim
We hope to make managing one’s health easy and enjoyable for everyone.
## User Stories
1. As a person who is looking for a healthier diet, I can input personal data of weight, height, and gender, and receive some customised weekly diet plans.
2. As a person who is looking to lose weight, I want to be able to have a personalised diet and exercise plan that can ensure the desired result.
3. As a person who is looking to build muscle, I want to be able to follow a reliable workout and nutrition plan that allows me to efficiently gain muscle mass.
4. As a person who wants to track body data and see the changes,  I want to be able to see easier-understood plots and receive notifications when there are negative changes of my body
5. As a student who wants to manage stress and keep track of weight, I want to be able to see personal health reports and what to do to release pressure & eat healthily.
